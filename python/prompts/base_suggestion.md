I need help analyzing a code change and suggesting improvements.

Here's the original file:
```rust
{original_content}
```

Here's the diff showing the change made:
```diff
{diff_content}
```

Change Summary: {change_summary}
Key identifiers involved: {identifiers}

{formatted_context}

Based on the change shown in the diff and the project context, please suggest what additional improvements or changes would make sense. Consider:
1. Consistency with the change pattern (e.g., if renaming Point to Point3D, consider adding 3D functionality)
2. Related code that should also be updated
3. Best practices for the type of change being made
4. Any potential issues or improvements

IMPORTANT: Your response must start with "FILE: <filename>" where <filename> is the name of the file being modified (e.g., "FILE: main.rs" or "FILE: lib.rs").

Please provide a clear, concise suggestion for what should be changed.
